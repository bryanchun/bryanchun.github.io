        body:
            -   Greetings! I'm Bryan with a 'y'. Thanks for dropping by.
            -   >
                I see programming as a medium of expression and computer science as a science/art of modelling things and automating them. That's why I am interested in a multitude of topics:
            -   topics:
                -   name: Artificial Intelligence & Machine/Deep Learning & Data Science
                    desc: having worked on a number of course and internship projects in this area, I am excited to see how data can enhance what we can currently do
                -   name: Programming Languages & Functional Programming
                    desc: I did research and is actively learning in this area, concerning language design, features and paradigms; especially functional ones
                -   name: Intersection of Mathematics and Computer Science
                    desc: as part of my math minor, I took courses in probability and data science, and is keen on learning about topics like algebra for programming languages, formal methods with logic, computability theory and algorithmic game theory
                -   desc: Currently learning about Security, Cryptography and Blockchain
            -   Apart from these, I am an avid photographer when I travel, and love calligraphy, graphic design and collecting quotes. You can also find me in badminton courts or matcha spots hunting.

                Privacy-preserving programmable interface for Blockchain-stored Data
            time: Jun - Aug 2019
            details:    # array
                -   This project attempts to extend the Data Markets, where users can sell and buy data directly with one another online through a blockchain platform,
                    to a more general data sharing and management solution, where individual data can be owned, transferred, and shared with others, through blockchain-enabled storage and privacy-preserving mechanisms.
                -   This allows users to reduce reliance on third-party cloud platforms and have fine-grained control over their own data.
                -   We propose a stack based on the IOTA Tangle to store and process data, and on top of which can allow publish/subscribe, permissioned data sharing, and customised data pipeline creation.
                -   Work in progress.
