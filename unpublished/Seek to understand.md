# Seek to understand - Georgia Tech Machine Learning Midterm reflection

I am just off from the midterm on Feb 26, 2019. I am not going to talk about the exam content in details since it does not help me to learn, instead let me write about lessons I learnt on how is it that we understand an truly grasp materials, according to the philosophy of Prof Charles Isbell and his teaching team

### To explain

Make explanation short. Conciseness trumps verbosity. It follows these steps

1. What is the matter?
2. How does it work in high level?
3. How can you explain it further, when needed?

### To reason

For each concept
1. What are starting motivations? The field setup?
2. What are the components that form this concept? Starting assumptions? 
3. How do that connect? What is the core process that makes it definitive?
4. How does this perform? When to use it? Strengths and Weaknesses? Compared to other approaches? No absolutes are allowed, nor the I don't care absolute

### To somehow memorise = To derive

Having this rooted strongly in your thoughts, it becomes natural and part of you to think about such matters. You **assimilated** it, not because it's new and novel (though they maybe) but because it's well understood and representative of your added knowledge.

This can look similar in effect to rote memorisation, but note the difference in rigour and purposes.

To derive can mean at various degrees:

- To derive the main components
- To derive the entire flow, logic, or process
- To derive understood comments and criticisms
